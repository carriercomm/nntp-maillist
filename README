= NNTP Mailing List Bridge =

Data for scripts is stored in either /etc/nntp-maillist/ (if accesible) or else in <install-dir>/etc/

newmail.rb is designed to be used as a Mail Deliver Agent, either directly, or piped from an alias, or piped from procmail, like so:

{{{
:0w
| /usr/bin/ruby /usr/share/nntp-maillist/newmail.rb nntp://news.example.com/ news.example.com
EXITCODE=$?
}}}

sendsubs.rb is designed to be used from a cronjob that runs it once for each group for which there are subscribers, running a command like:

{{{
for GROUP in /etc/nntp-maillist/*; do
	ruby sendsubs.rb nntp://news.example.com/"$GROUP" news.example.com
done
}}}
